<p>
VOICY is an web app that can convert .txt files into nearly human<p>
like voice and provide the .mp3 file generated(that has the dictated
version of text file) to user as an downloadable file.
<p>
This can be used to convert text files that has lecture notes into
voiceover, for easy understanding and to gain attention of students, as
students tend to listen eagerly than read with full concentration.
</p>
<p>
We have designed the app such that the user can change a lot of
parameters of the voice model like Voice, accent , gender , speed and
many more such that it will be appropriate for their use case.
